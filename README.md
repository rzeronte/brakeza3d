# Linux compilation

This project has been checked on Ubuntu 20.10 from CLI

In Unix systems we will only have to make sure that we have installed the development packages of the libraries that we need

``` 
apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-dev \
libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libbullet-dev libbullet2.88 libassimp-dev \
libassimp5 assimp-utils intel-opencl-icd intel-opencl-icd libglm-dev
```

``` 
git clone https://github.com/rzeronte/brakeza3d.git brakeza3D
cd brakeza3D
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Windows compilation

Is not complex, but you will have to download the compiler and libraries to compile it by yourself.

Here for detailed instructions for installing with CLion + MinGW:

# OSX compilation

Currently, I do not compile for Mac, but the project was started on it, so that it shouldn't vary much compared to compiling with Linux, once the dependencies are satisfied.
