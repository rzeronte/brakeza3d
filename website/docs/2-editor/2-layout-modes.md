# Layout modes
---

**Brakeza3D** offers three default widget layouts, designed for different workflow types.
It’s important to note that the functionality remains the same; only the visual arrangement of the widgets on the screen changes.

## Default layout
---

The default layout provides **a balance between the other two layouts**. In this layout, you can easily access the object inspector, its properties, system logs, and the browsers for loading resources.

## Developers layout
---

The Developers layout is designed **to focus on LUA script coding tasks**. You have access to the object inspector, its properties, as well as its associated scripts and shaders. This layout also includes the code editor.

## Design layout
---

The Designers layout is designed **to optimize the scene view area** while keeping the object inspector and its properties window accessible. It is ideal for scene assembly.

In the main menu, you will find the `Windows` section, which provides access to all the available windows in the application.
