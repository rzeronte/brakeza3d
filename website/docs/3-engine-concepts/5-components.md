# Components

Components represent the core aspects of **Brakeza3D**. All functionality is channeled through these components, so you will frequently interact 
with them mainly from your `LUA Scripts`.

| Component  | Description                                                                                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Window     | Responsible for initializing the operating system window and managing the framebuffers displayed on screen |
| Render     | Handles global illumination, shader management, and other rendering-related tasks                          |
| Input      | Provides access to keyboard, mouse, and game controller input                                              |
| Camera     | Manages camera behavior and view transformations                                                           |
| Collisions | Handles collision detection and physics interactions                                                       |
| Scripting  | Provides scripting support and script execution management                                                 |

In the `Scripting API` section, you will find a comprehensive reference of all the methods exposed by each component for developers, including their usage and purpose.
