The main goal is to encourage collaboration, learning, and faster development through high-quality community-driven resources.\n\n![Assets Hub](/img/hub/01.png)\n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\n## Deep Integration with Brakeza3D\n\nAssets Hub is **directly integrated into the Brakeza3D engine**. The engine now includes a built-in client that allows users to:\n\n- Log in to their Assets Hub account\n- Browse community-created assets\n- Vote and rate resources\n- Download scripts and shaders created by third parties\n\nAll of this happens without leaving the engine, keeping the workflow fast and seamless.\n\n## Web Portal for Asset Management\n\nAssets Hub is also available as a **web platform** at:\n\nhttps://hub.brakeza.com/\n\nFrom the web interface, creators can **upload, update, and manage their assets**, making it easy to maintain and showcase their contributions to the community.\n\n## Alpha Status\n\nAssets Hub is currently in **alpha**, which means it is still under active development. Features, workflows, and APIs may change in the coming weeks as we iterate based on feedback.\n\nThis early stage is a great opportunity for the community to test the platform and help shape its future.\n\n## Free and Ad-Free\n\nAssets Hub is a **free service**, with **no advertisements** and no hidden costs. It is built to support the Brakeza3D community and promote open sharing and collaboration.\n\n---\n\n![Assets Hub](/img/hub/02.png)"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-07-welcome.md","title":"Welcome to Brakeza3D!","description":"The Brakeza3D website has been completely relaunched as a site dedicated to providing solid and up-to-date documentation.","date":"2026-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"brakeza3d","permalink":"/blog/tags/brakeza-3-d"},{"inline":true,"label":"news","permalink":"/blog/tags/news"},{"inline":true,"label":"welcome","permalink":"/blog/tags/welcome"}],"readingTime":0.41,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo","title":"Lead Developer @ Brakeza3D","url":"https://github.com/rzeronte","imageURL":"https://github.com/rzeronte.png","key":"eduardo","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome to Brakeza3D!","authors":["eduardo"],"tags":["brakeza3d","news","welcome"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Assets Hub Alpha released!","permalink":"/blog/assets-hub"}},"content":"The **Brakeza3D** website has been completely relaunched as a site dedicated to providing **solid and up-to-date documentation**.\n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\nWe’ve redesigned the website from the ground up to make it easier for developers to find tutorials, API references, download links, and more.  \n\nThe goal is to help both new and experienced users get the most out of the Brakeza3D engine efficiently.\n\nStay tuned for updates, tutorials, and examples that will guide you in creating amazing 2D and 3D games with Brakeza3D!."}]}}
