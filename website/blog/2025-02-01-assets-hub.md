## Assets Hub Alpha Released 🚀

We’re excited to announce the **alpha release of Assets Hub**, a new platform designed to expand and strengthen the Brakeza3D ecosystem.

Assets Hub is an integrated portal where the community can **share, discover, and reuse scripts and shaders** created by other Brakeza3D users. The main goal is to encourage collaboration, learning, and faster development through high-quality community-driven resources.

## Deep Integration with Brakeza3D

Assets Hub is **directly integrated into the Brakeza3D engine**. The engine now includes a built-in client that allows users to:

- Log in to their Assets Hub account
- Browse community-created assets
- Vote and rate resources
- Download scripts and shaders created by third parties

All of this happens without leaving the engine, keeping the workflow fast and seamless.

## Web Portal for Asset Management

Assets Hub is also available as a **web platform** at:

https://hub.brakeza.com/

From the web interface, creators can **upload, update, and manage their assets**, making it easy to maintain and showcase their contributions to the community.

## Alpha Status

Assets Hub is currently in **alpha**, which means it is still under active development. Features, workflows, and APIs may change in the coming weeks as we iterate based on feedback.

This early stage is a great opportunity for the community to test the platform and help shape its future.

## Free and Ad-Free

Assets Hub is a **free service**, with **no advertisements** and no hidden costs. It is built to support the Brakeza3D community and promote open sharing and collaboration.
