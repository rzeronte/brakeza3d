========================================================================================================
01 - BASICS
=======================================================================================================

Brakeza3D is a simple and powerful cross-platform 2D/3D game engine designed for indie developers and small teams.
It features a clean, component-based architecture, a built-in scene editor, and full Lua scripting support, allowing
developers to prototype and build games quickly and efficiently.

Brakeza3D includes modern rendering with extensible GLSL shaders, integrated physics, and support for both 2D and 3D
workflows, making it a flexible foundation for a wide range of game projects.


========================================================================================================
# 1.1) MAIN CONCEPTS
========================================================================================================

In Brakeza3D, four main concepts are defined:

    - Projects
    - Scripts
    - Scenes
    - Objects


========================================================================================================
### 1.1.1) PROJECTS
========================================================================================================

A project is a container for scenes and scripts. It can be stored on disk as a JSON file and loaded at any time.

The project is the highest-level entity in Brakeza3D. In general, you will have one project per application or
game you are working on.


========================================================================================================
### 1.1.2) SCRIPTS
========================================================================================================

Scripts are Lua source code files used to interact with Brakeza3D. They execute the logic that brings your
application to life.

Scripts can be attached to projects, scenes, or objects to implement the desired behavior. They are stored
on disk as Lua files and can be loaded at any time. You can create as many scripts as needed.

In the scripting section, we will take a deeper look at this type of file.


========================================================================================================
### 1.1.3) SCENES
========================================================================================================

A scene is a container for objects and scripts. Scenes can be stored on disk and loaded at any time. The
content of a scene includes:

    - Objects
    - Scripts
    - Shaders
    - Camera position and rotation
    - ADS lighting configuration


========================================================================================================
### 1.1.4) OBJECTS
========================================================================================================

Entities in the 3D world. In general, any element that can be displayed on screen is an object, for
example: 3D models, lights, particle emitter...

All objects share the basic properties of a 3D element, such as name, position, rotation, and scale. Each
specific object type can extend these properties as needed.

From code, we can activate, move, rotate, delete, scale, and perform many other actions on objects.


========================================================================================================
1.2) GUI
========================================================================================================

Brakeza3D includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies many of the more tedious tasks.

It features a fully integrated scene editor connected to the scripting system.

While you can use your preferred code editor to work with scripts, the GUI is very useful for integrating
scripts, manipulating objects, configuring lighting, and saving or loading scenes.


========================================================================================================
1.3) COMPONENTS
========================================================================================================

Brakeza3D organizes its functionality into components. Each component represents a fundamental aspect of the engine core.

    - Window     : Manages the operating system window
    - Scripting  : Manages the scripting system
    - Camera     : Manages the camera
    - Collisions : Manages the physics and collision engine
    - Input      : Manages keyboard or gamepad input
    - Sound      : Manages sound playback
    - Render     : Manages rendering with OpenGL

You can access all of them through the component manager from your Lua scripts. Each component will be explained in detail later.
