========================================================================================================
01 - BASICS
=======================================================================================================

Brakeza3D is a simple and powerful cross-platform 2D/3D game engine designed for indie developers and small teams.
It features a clean, component-based architecture, a built-in scene editor, and full Lua scripting support, allowing
developers to prototype and build games quickly and efficiently.

Brakeza3D includes modern rendering with extensible GLSL shaders, integrated physics, and support for both 2D and 3D
workflows, making it a flexible foundation for a wide range of game projects.


========================================================================================================
# 1.1) MAIN CONCEPTS
========================================================================================================

In Brakeza3D, four main concepts are defined:

    - Projects
    - Scripts
    - Scenes
    - Objects


========================================================================================================
### 1.1.1) PROJECTS
========================================================================================================

A project is a container for scenes and scripts. It can be stored on disk as a JSON file and loaded at any time.

The project is the highest-level entity in Brakeza3D. In general, you will have one project per application or
game you are working on.


========================================================================================================
### 1.1.2) SCRIPTS
========================================================================================================

Scripts are Lua source code files used to interact with Brakeza3D. They execute the logic that brings your
application to life.

Scripts can be attached to projects, scenes, or objects to implement the desired behavior. They are stored
on disk as Lua files and can be loaded at any time. You can create as many scripts as needed.

In the scripting section, we will take a deeper look at this type of file.


========================================================================================================
### 1.1.3) SCENES
========================================================================================================

A scene is a container for objects and scripts. Scenes can be stored on disk and loaded at any time. The
content of a scene includes:

    - Objects
    - Scripts
    - Shaders
    - Camera position and rotation
    - ADS lighting configuration


========================================================================================================
### 1.1.4) OBJECTS
========================================================================================================

Entities in the 3D world. In general, any element that can be displayed on screen is an object, for
example: 3D models, lights, particle emitter...

All objects share the basic properties of a 3D element, such as name, position, rotation, and scale. Each
specific object type can extend these properties as needed.

From code, we can activate, move, rotate, delete, scale, and perform many other actions on objects.


========================================================================================================
1.2) GUI
========================================================================================================

The engine provides an integrated 3D development environment focused on real-time editing and iteration.
The GUI is designed to centralize scene creation, asset management, scripting, rendering, and debugging
within a single workflow.

Its main goal is to allow developers and designers to build, modify, and test scenes interactively,
reducing iteration time while maintaining full control over rendering, logic, and performance.


========================================================================================================
## 1.2.1) Scene Management
========================================================================================================

Scenes can be created, loaded, and executed directly from the GUI. The interface allows users to quickly
switch between scenes and control their execution state, making it easy to test changes in real time.

This system supports a smooth workflow where scene structure, behavior, and visual elements can be adjusted
without leaving the editor.


========================================================================================================
## 1.2.2) Scene Objects
========================================================================================================

Objects can be added to the scene through the GUI and organized hierarchically. Each object exposes
editable properties such as transformation, materials, and other engine-specific parameters.

Changes applied to objects are immediately reflected in the scene, enabling precise placement and fast
visual feedback during development.


========================================================================================================
## 1.2.3) Scripting System
========================================================================================================

The engine supports scripting using LUA, which can be attached to individual objects or entire scenes.
Scripts can be assigned via drag-and-drop directly from the GUI.

During execution, script variables can be monitored and modified in real time, allowing for efficient
debugging and behavior tuning without recompilation.


========================================================================================================
## 1.2.4) Shaders System
========================================================================================================

Shaders can be assigned to objects and materials directly from the editor. The GUI includes tools for
editing shaders written in GLSL, enabling developers to experiment with visual effects inside the engine.

Shader parameters are exposed and adjustable at runtime, making it easy to fine-tune the visual appearance
of objects and lighting.


========================================================================================================
## 1.2.5) Lighting
========================================================================================================

The lighting system allows users to create and configure different types of lights within the scene. All
lighting properties can be edited through the GUI, with immediate visual feedback.

This enables artists and designers to iterate quickly on scene mood and atmosphere while maintaining technical
control over lighting behavior.


========================================================================================================
1.3) Components
========================================================================================================

Brakeza3D organizes its functionality into components. Each component represents a fundamental aspect of the engine core.

    - Window     : Manages the operating system window
    - Scripting  : Manages the scripting system
    - Camera     : Manages the camera
    - Collisions : Manages the physics and collision engine
    - Input      : Manages keyboard or gamepad input
    - Sound      : Manages sound playback
    - Render     : Manages rendering with OpenGL

You can access all of them through the component manager from your Lua scripts. Each component will be explained in detail later.
