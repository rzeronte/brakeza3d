The response from the community has been incredibly positive and motivating, and it truly means a lot to see so many people interested, testing the engine, and asking how they can use it or contribute.\\r\\n\\r\\n## About the roadmap\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the questions that keeps coming up in messages is:\\r\\n\\r\\n> *What is the project\'s roadmap?*\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is clear and honest:  \\r\\n**The current priority is not to add lots of new features, but to stabilize and consolidate the project.**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main focus right now is:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Stabilizing the engine\\r\\n- Improving internal consistency\\r\\n- Exposing **100% of the engine\u2019s functionality to LUA**\\r\\n- Properly documenting that API\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the moment, the LUA API is still limited, and before expanding the engine with new capabilities, I want to make sure everything that already exists is:\\r\\n\\r\\n- accessible\\r\\n- stable\\r\\n- documented\\r\\n- maintainable\\r\\n\\r\\nThis step is essential to make the project truly usable in the long term.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Priorities for the coming months\\r\\n\\r\\nThe priority order will be:\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Bug fixing**\\r\\n2. **Documenting the LUA API and the C++ core**\\r\\n3. **Desired features**\\r\\n4. **Long-term features**\\r\\n\\r\\nThis order is intentional. An engine with many features but poor stability or documentation ends up being frustrating for users. I prefer building a solid foundation before accelerating development.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Desired features (mid-term)\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are some improvements planned that will be implemented progressively:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Improve user experience in the interface\\r\\n- Enable geometry streaming for Mesh3D objects\\r\\n- Add a basic version of node-based geometry shaders\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of these ideas come directly from community feedback, which helps a lot when deciding what actually brings value.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Long-term features (or subject to reconsideration)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also deeper evolution paths that require analysis and experimentation before any decision is made:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Decouple OpenGL / Create a Vulkan backend\\r\\n- Explore alternative scripting language options\\r\\n- Change the project\'s license type\\r\\n\\r\\nThese decisions affect the architecture, philosophy, and long-term direction of the engine, so they will be evaluated carefully and with community feedback.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Thanks again\\r\\n\\r\\nTo close, I want to repeat the most important thing:  \\r\\n**thank you for the interest, feedback, and support.**\\r\\n\\r\\nThis project keeps moving forward thanks to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\u2019s keep going \ud83d\ude80"},{"id":"brakeza3d-0-26-2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/brakeza3d-0-26-2","source":"@site/blog/2026-02-07-launch-0.26.2-release.md","title":"Brakeza3D 0.26.2 released!","description":"Brakeza3D 0.26.2 is now available!
