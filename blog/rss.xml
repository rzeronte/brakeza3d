<p>We’re excited to announce the <strong>alpha release of Assets Hub</strong>, a new platform designed to expand and strengthen the Brakeza3D ecosystem.</p>
<p>Assets Hub is an integrated portal where the community can <strong>share, discover, and reuse scripts and shaders</strong> created by other Brakeza3D users. The main goal is to encourage collaboration, learning, and faster development through high-quality community-driven resources.</p>

<p>Assets Hub is <strong>directly integrated into the Brakeza3D engine</strong>. The engine now includes a built-in client that allows users to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Log in to their Assets Hub account</li>
<li class="">Browse community-created assets</li>
<li class="">Vote and rate resources</li>
<li class="">Download scripts and shaders created by third parties</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this happens without leaving the engine, keeping the workflow fast and seamless.</p>

<p>Assets Hub is also available as a <strong>web platform</strong> at:</p>
<p><a href="https://hub.brakeza.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://hub.brakeza.com/</a></p>
<p>From the web interface, creators can <strong>upload, update, and manage their assets</strong>, making it easy to maintain and showcase their contributions to the community.</p>

<p>Assets Hub is currently in <strong>alpha</strong>, which means it is still under active development. Features, workflows, and APIs may change in the coming weeks as we iterate based on feedback.</p>
<p>This early stage is a great opportunity for the community to test the platform and help shape its future.</p>

<p>Assets Hub is a <strong>free service</strong>, with <strong>no advertisements</strong> and no hidden costs. It is built to support the Brakeza3D community and promote open sharing and collaboration.</p>
